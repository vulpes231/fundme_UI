## Overview

FundMe is a decentralized web application that allows users to send funds to a smart contract and later withdraw those funds. It leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent fund transfers.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contract Development:** We used Hardhat, Ether.js, and Solidity to create a robust and secure smart contract that handles fund transfers.
  
- **Frontend:** The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Key Features
